      <description>I think (or at least I hope) that everyone has similar issues with productivity. There are a lot of things that we want to do, but also there is Stargate to rewatch and the remaster of Command &amp;amp; Conquer just came out &amp;#8853; Because apparently I just want it to be the late 90â€™s again. Is that so wrong?  and those things are easier than actually doing anything productive.</description>
