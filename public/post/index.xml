      <description>I’m a little wary of the DRAFT functionality in blogdown/hugo. So this might get published too soon if it doesn’t work.I guess we’ll see if it does.
This will hopefully be a bit more complete than last month’s entry. I’m going to try and keep it updated as I go.So, in roughly date order:
Bought the child tiny potion bottles so she can make tiny potions. They’re adorable and imported from china for pennies.</description>

      <description>I’m going to try and keep a track of how various projects are going all in one place and push it at the end of the month.This means I can make a note of smaller progress that doesn’t warrant a post of it’s own.
Interface2nd July 2020Another fairly radical overhaul.I’ve set up an openhab server. Openhabe has already done the hard work of setting up bindings to common household smart devices.</description>

      <description>The child watches a lot of YouTube. A lot of it is completely terrible and I wish they would watch less.One of the channels they watch is called “Slick Slime Sam” It is one of the ones that I don’t mind all that much because it features a person &amp;#8853; Well, a persons hands and voice. Presumably there is a person attached.  assisted by a pink creature &amp;#8853; I’m not sure what it’s supposed to be.</description>

      <description>yesRiver freight and local hubs.Most towns in Britain are built around a river. Not all, but most.This is because rivers provide several vital functions.
Firstly, how do you get fresh water.Secondly, how do you get rid of sewage.Rivers are great at both of these, for a while. But as the numbers go up, so do the problems.
Rivers are also pretty great for moving stuff around.</description>

      <description>Some people I know aspire to read a lot. To that end they’re recording their monthly reading on their notebook. I’ve not found the time or motivation to do a lot of reading, nor do I especially aspire to.I do aspire to do interesting things. Life is easier when you sit around watching stargate and playing computer games from the 90s, but it’s more fulfilling when you do some interesting things.</description>

      <title>Why to write every day?</title>

      <description>There are a lot of articles about maing writing every day a habit.
Engineers (a category which I broadly include myself, if only because I don’t know what other title I can choose) are not very good writers.From what I can tell there is only one way to improve this, and that is by writing. My wife started a daily(ish) writing habit and was very quickly churning out very good writing.</description>

      <description>I think (or at least I hope) that everyone has similar issues with productivity. There are a lot of things that we want to do, but also there is Stargate to rewatch and the remaster of Command &amp;amp; Conquer just came out &amp;#8853; Because apparently I just want it to be the late 90’s again. Is that so wrong?  and those things are easier than actually doing anything productive.</description>

      <description>R studio has a very helpful tool called snippets.&amp;#8853; So… this was supposed to be a very quick post about a nice thing I found to speed up my workflow. But I wanted to write in the post the literal shortcodes used. This meant that they were interpreted and turned into a marginnote rather than displayed.
What I needed to do was escape the shortcodes, but nothing I tried seemed to work.</description>

      <description>The original plan for my boat interface project was that I would build a console in the wheelhouse &amp;#8853; After I built the wheelhouse…  with touchscreens integrated into it. Each touchscreen would have an LCARS panel loaded, but would work independently.Any data they needed (or generated) would be fetched from a central server (or sent back) as needed. Each display could be set to any panel as needed, but would have it’s own primary function.</description>

      <description>Today’s project was to try and enhance the very basic interface I built yesterday.
HomeFirst I built a frontpage to let me navigate around the application. It currently looks like this:
It works quite nicely on a full screen touch panel.
Since it’s running in shiny it automatically exists as a server on the network.I’ve given it a fixed port to run on so that you can access it from any device on the boat.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing around with the idea of bringing together a bunch of my boat’s information and control systems into one slightly more cohesive control console.
I put a little bit of time into putting together an appropriate console to test the pump control. &amp;#8853; The control system for the pump is hopefully only a stopgap solution. It should be possible to control all the systems without having to go out to the internet and back.</description>

      <description>Who wants a post that’s super niche and also kinda dumb.
It occasionally occurs to me that there is a similarity between the words Q’apla and Kree. &amp;#8853; Q’apla in Klingon.  Q’apla is, of course Klingon for “Victory”. But Klingons being Klingons it’s often used to mean, “Get Ready” or “Good Luck” or “Attention”
Kree is Jaffa for “Yoo Hoo!”. But also can be used as a term meaning “Attention!</description>

      <description>I have this boat that I live in.I have long had plans to add automation solutions and sensors and all sorts of fun things to it. But I’ve rarely had the time or energy, and also things like floors and walls have generally taken precedence.
We now have quite a few floors &amp;#8853; Also quite a few flaws, but I’m working on that.  and walls, albeit not quite as many as we should have.</description>

      <description>There are some crows on the island.
A few years ago I came home from the shops with a little snack, a hot cumberland sausage on a stick. I was going to sit on the deck of my boat with a drink and a sausage. I went down into the boat to get some ice and a glass. A crow flapped up on to the mast of the boat moored next to mine, and I heard a caw-caw noise.</description>

      <description>I’m not a great cook. I would say that I am broadly competent. I do however consider myself to be a reasonably good solver of problems. So in that spirit I’m going to write this whilst I am cooking this recipe. &amp;#8853; Or at least whilst I try and invent a suitable recipe  This may turn out to be a complete disaster. But on the principle that you should report all your trials (and not just the succesful ones) I’m going to write as I cook.</description>

      <description>A drabble is a short piece of fiction 100 words in length. This is not quite that, It’s an attempt to explain a concept in exactly 100 words. This is my first go writing to this particular format, but if you’d like to see it done well (and to learn some philosophy at the same time) have a look at these.
An idempotent function is one which if run multiple times produces the same output as if it were run only once.</description>

      <description>I found an old camera when I was tidying up. So I decided to try and find a use for it.
The camera is a TP-Link NC250. It’s an end of life product so is unsupported.The first step was to plug it in and see if it would connect. The first experiment yielded very little. It was connecting via an extension router. I tried both WPS and ethernet, but the TPCamera app reported “Can’t Find Camera”.</description>

      <description>Hyperloop really annoys me. It annoys me for a number of reasons, but the first is that I’m writing about Hyperloop style systems by using the name Hyperloop.
The idea of firing a capsule through a low pressure tube using magnetic propulsion is not a new idea. It’s easily a hundred years old. But because someone who’s only skill is to be rich and to not know what they’re doing &amp;#8853; This is a skill.</description>

      <description>This is planned to be a brief note on the things I used to make this website.
I needed to make a website for someone to post their daily writing. &amp;#8853; It turned out that this daily writing habit was having a lot of benefits for them, so I copied it  So, my first instinct was of course, to load up R Studio and start there.</description>

      <description>I was working on a more complicated post about timetable data formats, but I’ve parked it for now because the child needed to be taken out to the woods to play. As we were watching the clouds of billions of tiny flies lit up by the setting sun and pretending to be galaxies I asked the child what I should write about instead. They said “Butterflies”.
So here is a short post about butterflies.</description>

      <description>I was just watching the new(ish) Cinderella film (Because I have a small child who was busy ignoring it). It was pretty good. Though true to the original animated one Cinderella has basically zero agency and things just happen to her. &amp;#8853; I liked the goose though.  It made me think of some alternate takes on the story.
Magic as a weapon of social privilege.Cinderella marries Prince Charming &amp;#8853; He’s lucky he’s a prince, with a name like that.</description>

      <description>I haven’t used much R Markdown before. I briefly played about with it for producing self reporting models, but the transport consulting world likes what it likes. &amp;#8853; and what they like is excel models and word reports  I haven’t had the time to explore further. So this writing site is my main experiment area for R Markdown.
I’m going to look into an R Markdown solution for my recipes problem.</description>

      <description>There are two things that humans do very well, often without conciously thinking about it. Tool Use and Communication.
Subconcious communication is a topic of special interest to me, because there are a lot of things that human brains do automatically which mine, mostly doesn’t.I have a thing called prosopognasia, an inability to automatically recognise faces. &amp;#8853; To be precise I have a variant of this called prosopamnesia. In brief, there is a specialised bit of brain which does face recognistion and storage.</description>

      <description>I have a fascination with Elephants.One of the goals of the daily writing practice is to contribute towards a biography of famous elephants.&amp;#8853; I think it might take a while before I get to that point, so I’ll probably revisit the stories of different elephants a fair bit on the way. This piece is really intended to be a very very brief introduction to Topsy This came about after reading about Topsy.</description>

      <description>I aspired to be a writer when I was younger.
When I was (I think) 7 I won an award for writing. I had written a story for a normal school assignment &amp;#8853; Oddly I can’t remember any of the details of the story.  but one of the teachers &amp;#8853; Mrs McCarthey, I believe.  really liked the story and submitted it as an entry to the South Wales Writing Association.</description>
