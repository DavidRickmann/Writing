Who wants a post that's super niche and also kinda dumb.

It occasionally occurs to me that there is a similarity between the words Q'apla and Krie. {{% marginnote %}} ![](/img/Qapla.png)   
Q'aplan in Klingon. {{% /marginnote %}}

Q'apla is, of course Klingon for "Victory". But Klingons being Klingons it's often used to mean, "Get Ready" or "Good Luck" or "Attention"

Kree is Jaffa for "Yoo Hoo!". But also can be used as a term meaning "Attention!" or "Concentrate" or similar things.

So, are there any words which mean something but can also be used as a phrase expressing generalised approval or excitement?
I submit to you [Yeet](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yeet).
This is a word which is commonly used to mean "To hurl with great force" but is also used to mean "Yes!" 

It was coined in 2000 but became popular in about 2014. 
In fact, let's marginally redeem this post with a bit of R to find out when it became popular.


``` {r, eval=T, echo=T, warning=FALSE} 
library(gtrendsR)

res <- gtrends(c("yeet"))
plot(res)

```

Looks like a significant peak in late 2019, decreasing ever since. Thanks gtrendsR.


So there you go.
What's the equivalent to Q'apla or Kree in English?   
YEET!

Here's one of the Vines that contributed to Yeet's popularity.
