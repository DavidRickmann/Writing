*More on cooking*
Should we key the ingredients?
Does it make sense to have butter (for example) listed more than once.
Well, yes, if you use it for different things.
Quite often a cake will have butter but will also have butter cream frosting. If it's all listed together you need to specifiy in the recipe how much to use. I think it would be better to have a field listing sub assemblies of the recipe and keying on sub assembly+ingredient
