  <p>R studio has a very helpful tool called snippets.&#8853; So… this was supposed to be a very quick post about a nice thing I found to speed up my workflow. But I wanted to write in the post the literal shortcodes used. This meant that they were interpreted and turned into a marginnote rather than displayed.
What I needed to do was escape the shortcodes, but nothing I tried seemed to work.</p>

  <p>The original plan for my boat interface project was that I would build a console in the wheelhouse &#8853; After I built the wheelhouse…  with touchscreens integrated into it. Each touchscreen would have an LCARS panel loaded, but would work independently.Any data they needed (or generated) would be fetched from a central server (or sent back) as needed. Each display could be set to any panel as needed, but would have it’s own primary function.</p>

  <p>Today’s project was to try and enhance the very basic interface I built yesterday.
HomeFirst I built a frontpage to let me navigate around the application. It currently looks like this:
It works quite nicely on a full screen touch panel.
Since it’s running in shiny it automatically exists as a server on the network.I’ve given it a fixed port to run on so that you can access it from any device on the boat.</p>

  <p>I’ve been playing around with the idea of bringing together a bunch of my boat’s information and control systems into one slightly more cohesive control console.
I put a little bit of time into putting together an appropriate console to test the pump control. &#8853; The control system for the pump is hopefully only a stopgap solution. It should be possible to control all the systems without having to go out to the internet and back.</p>

  <p>Who wants a post that’s super niche and also kinda dumb.
It occasionally occurs to me that there is a similarity between the words Q’apla and Kree. &#8853; Q’apla in Klingon.  Q’apla is, of course Klingon for “Victory”. But Klingons being Klingons it’s often used to mean, “Get Ready” or “Good Luck” or “Attention”
Kree is Jaffa for “Yoo Hoo!”. But also can be used as a term meaning “Attention!</p>

  <p>I have this boat that I live in.I have long had plans to add automation solutions and sensors and all sorts of fun things to it. But I’ve rarely had the time or energy, and also things like floors and walls have generally taken precedence.
We now have quite a few floors &#8853; Also quite a few flaws, but I’m working on that.  and walls, albeit not quite as many as we should have.</p>

  <p>There are some crows on the island.
A few years ago I came home from the shops with a little snack, a hot cumberland sausage on a stick. I was going to sit on the deck of my boat with a drink and a sausage. I went down into the boat to get some ice and a glass. A crow flapped up on to the mast of the boat moored next to mine, and I heard a caw-caw noise.</p>

  <p>I’m not a great cook. I would say that I am broadly competent. I do however consider myself to be a reasonably good solver of problems. So in that spirit I’m going to write this whilst I am cooking this recipe. &#8853; Or at least whilst I try and invent a suitable recipe  This may turn out to be a complete disaster. But on the principle that you should report all your trials (and not just the succesful ones) I’m going to write as I cook.</p>

  <p>A drabble is a short piece of fiction 100 words in length. This is not quite that, It’s an attempt to explain a concept in exactly 100 words. This is my first go writing to this particular format, but if you’d like to see it done well (and to learn some philosophy at the same time) have a look at these.
An idempotent function is one which if run multiple times produces the same output as if it were run only once.</p>

  <p>I found an old camera when I was tidying up. So I decided to try and find a use for it.
The camera is a TP-Link NC250. It’s an end of life product so is unsupported.The first step was to plug it in and see if it would connect. The first experiment yielded very little. It was connecting via an extension router. I tried both WPS and ethernet, but the TPCamera app reported “Can’t Find Camera”.</p>
