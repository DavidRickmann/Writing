  <p>There are a lot of articles about maing writing every day a habit.
Engineers (a category which I broadly include myself, if only because I don’t know what other title I can choose) are not very good writers.From what I can tell there is only one way to improve this, and that is by writing. My wife started a daily(ish) writing habit and was very quickly churning out very good writing.</p>

  <p>I think (or at least I hope) that everyone has similar issues with productivity. There are a lot of things that we want to do, but also there is Stargate to rewatch and the remaster of Command &amp; Conquer just came out &#8853; Because apparently I just want it to be the late 90’s again. Is that so wrong?  and those things are easier than actually doing anything productive.</p>

  <p>R studio has a very helpful tool called snippets.&#8853; So… this was supposed to be a very quick post about a nice thing I found to speed up my workflow. But I wanted to write in the post the literal shortcodes used. This meant that they were interpreted and turned into a marginnote rather than displayed.
What I needed to do was escape the shortcodes, but nothing I tried seemed to work.</p>

  <p>The original plan for my boat interface project was that I would build a console in the wheelhouse &#8853; After I built the wheelhouse…  with touchscreens integrated into it. Each touchscreen would have an LCARS panel loaded, but would work independently.Any data they needed (or generated) would be fetched from a central server (or sent back) as needed. Each display could be set to any panel as needed, but would have it’s own primary function.</p>

  <p>More on cookingShould we key the ingredients?Does it make sense to have butter (for example) listed more than once.Well, yes, if you use it for different things.Quite often a cake will have butter but will also have butter cream frosting. If it’s all listed together you need to specifiy in the recipe how much to use. I think it would be better to have a field listing sub assemblies of the recipe and keying on sub assembly+ingredientreference cooking for engineers</p>

  <p>Today’s project was to try and enhance the very basic interface I built yesterday.
HomeFirst I built a frontpage to let me navigate around the application. It currently looks like this:
It works quite nicely on a full screen touch panel.
Since it’s running in shiny it automatically exists as a server on the network.I’ve given it a fixed port to run on so that you can access it from any device on the boat.</p>

  <p>I’ve been playing around with the idea of bringing together a bunch of my boat’s information and control systems into one slightly more cohesive control console.
I put a little bit of time into putting together an appropriate console to test the pump control. &#8853; The control system for the pump is hopefully only a stopgap solution. It should be possible to control all the systems without having to go out to the internet and back.</p>

  <p>Who wants a post that’s super niche and also kinda dumb.
It occasionally occurs to me that there is a similarity between the words Q’apla and Kree. &#8853; Q’apla in Klingon.  Q’apla is, of course Klingon for “Victory”. But Klingons being Klingons it’s often used to mean, “Get Ready” or “Good Luck” or “Attention”
Kree is Jaffa for “Yoo Hoo!”. But also can be used as a term meaning “Attention!</p>

  <p>I have this boat that I live in.I have long had plans to add automation solutions and sensors and all sorts of fun things to it. But I’ve rarely had the time or energy, and also things like floors and walls have generally taken precedence.
We now have quite a few floors &#8853; Also quite a few flaws, but I’m working on that.  and walls, albeit not quite as many as we should have.</p>

  <p>There are some crows on the island.
A few years ago I came home from the shops with a little snack, a hot cumberland sausage on a stick. I was going to sit on the deck of my boat with a drink and a sausage. I went down into the boat to get some ice and a glass. A crow flapped up on to the mast of the boat moored next to mine, and I heard a caw-caw noise.</p>
