  <p>I’m a little wary of the DRAFT functionality in blogdown/hugo. So this might get published too soon if it doesn’t work.I guess we’ll see if it does.
This will hopefully be a bit more complete than last month’s entry. I’m going to try and keep it updated as I go.So, in roughly date order:
Bought the child tiny potion bottles so she can make tiny potions. They’re adorable and imported from china for pennies.</p>

  <p>I’m going to try and keep a track of how various projects are going all in one place and push it at the end of the month.This means I can make a note of smaller progress that doesn’t warrant a post of it’s own.
Interface2nd July 2020Another fairly radical overhaul.I’ve set up an openhab server. Openhabe has already done the hard work of setting up bindings to common household smart devices.</p>

  <p>The child watches a lot of YouTube. A lot of it is completely terrible and I wish they would watch less.One of the channels they watch is called “Slick Slime Sam” It is one of the ones that I don’t mind all that much because it features a person &#8853; Well, a persons hands and voice. Presumably there is a person attached.  assisted by a pink creature &#8853; I’m not sure what it’s supposed to be.</p>

  <p>yesRiver freight and local hubs.Most towns in Britain are built around a river. Not all, but most.This is because rivers provide several vital functions.
Firstly, how do you get fresh water.Secondly, how do you get rid of sewage.Rivers are great at both of these, for a while. But as the numbers go up, so do the problems.
Rivers are also pretty great for moving stuff around.</p>

  <p>Some people I know aspire to read a lot. To that end they’re recording their monthly reading on their notebook. I’ve not found the time or motivation to do a lot of reading, nor do I especially aspire to.I do aspire to do interesting things. Life is easier when you sit around watching stargate and playing computer games from the 90s, but it’s more fulfilling when you do some interesting things.</p>

  <p>There are a lot of articles about maing writing every day a habit.
Engineers (a category which I broadly include myself, if only because I don’t know what other title I can choose) are not very good writers.From what I can tell there is only one way to improve this, and that is by writing. My wife started a daily(ish) writing habit and was very quickly churning out very good writing.</p>

  <p>I think (or at least I hope) that everyone has similar issues with productivity. There are a lot of things that we want to do, but also there is Stargate to rewatch and the remaster of Command &amp; Conquer just came out &#8853; Because apparently I just want it to be the late 90’s again. Is that so wrong?  and those things are easier than actually doing anything productive.</p>

  <p>R studio has a very helpful tool called snippets.&#8853; So… this was supposed to be a very quick post about a nice thing I found to speed up my workflow. But I wanted to write in the post the literal shortcodes used. This meant that they were interpreted and turned into a marginnote rather than displayed.
What I needed to do was escape the shortcodes, but nothing I tried seemed to work.</p>

  <p>The original plan for my boat interface project was that I would build a console in the wheelhouse &#8853; After I built the wheelhouse…  with touchscreens integrated into it. Each touchscreen would have an LCARS panel loaded, but would work independently.Any data they needed (or generated) would be fetched from a central server (or sent back) as needed. Each display could be set to any panel as needed, but would have it’s own primary function.</p>

  <p>Today’s project was to try and enhance the very basic interface I built yesterday.
HomeFirst I built a frontpage to let me navigate around the application. It currently looks like this:
It works quite nicely on a full screen touch panel.
Since it’s running in shiny it automatically exists as a server on the network.I’ve given it a fixed port to run on so that you can access it from any device on the boat.</p>
