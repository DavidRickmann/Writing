      <description>There are two things that humans do very well, often without conciously thinking about it. Tool Use and Communication.
Subconcious communication is a topic of special interest to me, because there are a lot of things that human brains do automatically which mine, mostly doesn’t.I have a thing called prosopognasia, an inability to automatically recognise faces. &amp;#8853; To be precise I have a variant of this called prosopamnesia. In brief, there is a specialised bit of brain which does face recognistion and storage.</description>

      <description>I have a fascination with Elephants.One of the goals of the daily writing practice is to contribute towards a biography of famous elephants.&amp;#8853; I think it might take a while before I get to that point, so I’ll probably revisit the stories of different elephants a fair bit on the way. This piece is really intended to be a very very brief introduction to Topsy This came about after reading about Topsy.</description>

      <description>I aspired to be a writer when I was younger.
When I was (I think) 7 I won an award for writing. I had written a story for a normal school assignment &amp;#8853; Oddly I can’t remember any of the details of the story.  but one of the teachers &amp;#8853; Mrs McCarthey, I believe.  really liked the story and submitted it as an entry to the South Wales Writing Association.</description>
