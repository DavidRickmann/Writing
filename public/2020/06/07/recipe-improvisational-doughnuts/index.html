<p>I’m not a great cook. I would say that I am broadly competent. I do however consider myself to be a reasonably good solver of problems. So in that spirit I’m going to write this whilst I am cooking this recipe. <label for="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-0" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-0" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote"> Or at least whilst I try and invent a suitable recipe </span>

This may turn out to be a complete disaster. But on the principle that you should report all your trials (and not just the succesful ones) I’m going to write as I cook.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients for step one</strong><br />
1 Child who wants a doughnut<br />
1 lack of any doughnuts</p>
<p>I’m never one to back down from a challenge <label for="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote"> Unless I’m tired. Or busy. Or I don’t want to. Okay, fine I’m often one to back down from a challenge, but let’s say, for rhetorical purposes that I’m not, in fact, one to back down from a challenge </span>
 so I’m not going to simply declare defeat and try and feed the child some healthy fruit. No. I’m going to try and make there be doughnuts!</p>
<p>Firstly I do not have much oil. So frying is out of the question.
Also I recently had to visit my local hospital to have some crispy bits trimmed off my arm after an incident with a recalcitrant cheesebuger and a pan of hot oil so I am somewhat wary of hot oil right now.</p>
<p>So, baking.<br />
Do we have any yeast?<br />
No. Well, not really, there’s a sourdough fermenting in a jar.<br />
Also there is bread flour. That’s not going to make for a particularly timely or tasty doughnut.<br />
But…. Ah-ha. There is self raising flour.</p>
<p>So. Self raising flour. Let’s say 150g.<label for="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote"> These numbers are all a little approximate, because I added a bit more flour to get the consistency right </span>
<br />
We want them fluffy so. a bit of baking powder. 1tsp.<br />
Also we want them fluffy and fast. Let’s toss in the juice of this lemon that I was using for tequila sunrises.<br />
The acid of the lemon juice should reqact with the baking powder and give us bubbles.<br />
Sugar. Sure. Throw in some sugar. We only have brown sugar, so that’s what’s going in. Say… 80g<br />
Then top of the rest with your usual cake ingredients.<br />
Milk. 100ml?<br />
A Egg.<br />
Some oil. I am nearly out.. so 46 ml. Because that’s what I have.</p>
<p>Throw it all in a bowl together.<br />
Mixy mixy. <label for="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-3" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-3" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote"> Or get a child to mix it, which is what I did. </span>
</p>
<p>The next problem. I do not have a doughnut pan.
Why would I even have a doughnut pan.
I’ve got a cupcake pan.
Hmmm.
Ok. I’ve got a stack of shillings and some tin foil. So, wrap the shillings in tinfoil. <label for="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-4" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote"> The shillings were left over from a treasure hunt that we had at our wedding. I also used a few 2ps and 10ps, because I didnt have enough shillings </span>

Butter up the shillings.
Pour in the mix, about halfway up.
Bake in a hot oven. (I went with 220°) and from a few test runs is seems that 6 minutes does the job.
Blammo.<br />
<em>Buttered Shilling Doughnuts.</em></p>
<p>I will at some point finish my plans for a recipe system started <a href="/2020/05/30/recipes-in-r/">here</a> and if we all survive eating these, will add it in.</p>
<p><img src="/img/doughnuts.jpg" /></p>
<p>Upon presentation of my masterpiece I was duly informed that these were not proper doughnuts.
Proper doughnuts have icing and sprinkles.
I can report that my attempt to turn a fondant dinosaur into icing was at best a qualified success. <label for="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-5" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-fd5a88a05985f12ce26d8a7ac8fcd93a-5" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote"> Which is to say, not a success at all </span>
