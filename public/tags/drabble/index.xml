      <description>R studio has a very helpful tool called snippets.&amp;#8853; Soâ€¦ this was supposed to be a very quick post about a nice thing I found to speed up my workflow. But I wanted to write in the post the literal shortcodes used. This meant that they were interpreted and turned into a marginnote rather than displayed.
What I needed to do was escape the shortcodes, but nothing I tried seemed to work.</description>
