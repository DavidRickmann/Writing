Some [people I know](https://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk/series/reading/) aspire to read a lot. To that end they're recording their monthly reading on their notebook. I've not found the time or motivation to do a lot of reading, nor do I especially aspire to.
I do aspire to do interesting things. Life is easier when you sit around watching stargate and playing computer games from the 90s, but it's more fulfilling when you do some interesting things.

I think this month's list will be a bit uninteresting, partially because I've spent a week ill with *probably not* Covid19, partially because I didn't note down anything I did. 

- I filmed a nice [timelapse of the river tides.](2020/06/04/timelapse-experiments/) 

- Emptied out some pineapples to make pinacoladas served in their own pineapple skins. Served with bamboo straws and pink tiki parasols.

- Started work on an LCARS themed control interface for my boat. 

That's really all that comes to mind. 
There may have been more. There may not.
I will try and keep a draft version of next months list open so I can keep adding to it as I go.
That might inspire me to get moving and do something interesting.
