I'm going to try and keep a track of how various projects are going all in one place and push it at the end of the month. 
This means I can make a note of smaller progress that doesn't warrant a post of it's own.

## Interface
### 2nd July 2020

Another fairly radical overhaul.
I've set up an openhab server. Openhab has already done the hard work of setting up bindings to common household smart devices. I'm generally a fan of not reinventing the wheel. This also means there is a whole community of folks working on interesting ways to talk to house gadgets.
I'm assuming there isn't going to be an Openhab binding for rudder hydraulics or diesel engine controls. 
I want this system to be doing more than just smarthome gadget control (though that is very much the core use case) so I'm planning a hybrid system. The openhab server handling talking to all the gadgets and then the Interface on top.

Openhab as a REST API so I've rewritten all the controls to use that. It's pretty quick to add more.

I've ordered a wifi light switch from China which was quite cheap but will take months to arrive.
I've heard mixed reviews, but if it works I will get a couple more. The boat doesn't actually have main lights in the hold, only lamps. So I can build the automation in at source when I finally get round to installing them.
