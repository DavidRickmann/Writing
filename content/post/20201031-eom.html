<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Note Taking</h1>
<p>My note taking has dropped down to a weekly exercise, though still using Zettlr.
Also I finally added a bunch of projects to my <a href="https://www.davidrickmann.com">Proper Grown up website</a>.
These are all in markdown so can be easily repurposed. So that worked well.
There is so little detail in a lot of them. It’s kind of worrying how little I remember.</p>
</div>
<div id="ampdg" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> AMPDG</h1>
<p><a href="http://ampdg.pink">AMPDG.pink</a> is still up and running. I added some cute notecards to the site and set up a Twitter account. I have done one small adventure so far, which was to make a harvest loaf, so I could eat the mouse.
Job done.</p>
<p>I have my adventure picked out from the site for November!</p>
</div>
<div id="random-mail-surprises" class="section level1" number="3">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Random mail surprises?</h1>
<p>Bobcat in a box have so far sent me:</p>
<ul>
<li>some strange “Travel tokens”</li>
<li>Some fake acorns (Facorns)</li>
<li>A cat toy ball witha bell in.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not all that convinced by them as a service at this point.
I’ll let them continue for a bit though, and maybe tweak my parameters slightly.</p>
<p>I won a second little TripHunters prize!
I’m going to choose the prize a bit closer to my birthday, but it’s another £25 ish priced box of cookies/cheese/chocolate/soap type prize.
They are so far winning in the battle of tiny potential surprises.</p>

<div id="exercise" class="section level1" number="4">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Exercise</h1>
<div id="stretchy-bands" class="section level2" number="4.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Stretchy Bands</h2>
<p>I’m trying to improve the exercise I do.
I enhanced the stretchy bands that I got for shoulder physio and now have a set of them. They’re about good enough to do some exercises.</p>
</div>
<div id="stretchy-tubes" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Stretchy Tubes</h2>
<p>I’ve added some longer tubey types with handles and stuff to my office gym.
They’re good for lateral pulldowns and stuff.
I’ve already used all the bands together to get decent resistance, so I’m a bit concerned that they won’t be able to keep up. {{% marginnote %}} This is of course presuming I actually use them at all. {{% /marginnote %}}</p>
</div>
<div id="gymnastic-rings" class="section level2" number="4.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Gymnastic Rings</h2>
<p>I have some Gymnastic rings that I wanted to use for pull ups, but I haven’t found a good mounting point for them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ght" class="section level1" number="5">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> GHT</h1>
<p><span class="citation">@lisatomic</span> (from the internet) has started a discord about “Getting Hot”
This seems an interesting and fun goal and ties into the exercise.
I’ve started using noom {{% marginnote %}} A diet thing that Lisa has used before to some success {{% /marginnote %}} to assist in making me smaller.
The Office Gym should help me get bigger.
I should run, but so far have not done a great job of that.</p>
<p>Next up is clothes and grooming.
All of my clothes are a disaster. Holes and all sorts. So I need new ones. But I don’t know how to do clothes.
GHT can help I hope.</p>
