<p>Who wants a post that’s super niche and also kinda dumb.</p>
<p>It occasionally occurs to me that there is a similarity between the words Q’apla and Krie. {{% marginnote %}} <img src="/img/Qapla.png" /><br />
Q’aplan in Klingon. {{% /marginnote %}}</p>
<p>Q’apla is, of course Klingon for “Victory”. But Klingons being Klingons it’s often used to mean, “Get Ready” or “Good Luck” or “Attention”</p>
<p>Kree is Jaffa for “Yoo Hoo!”. But also can be used as a term meaning “Attention!” or “Concentrate” or similar things.</p>
<p>So, are there any words which mean something but can also be used as a phrase expressing generalised approval or excitement?
I submit to you <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yeet">Yeet</a>.
This is a word which is commonly used to mean “To hurl with great force” but is also used to mean “Yes!”</p>
<p>It was coined in 2000 but became popular in about 2014.
In fact, let’s marginally redeem this post with a bit of R to find out when it became popular.</p>

<p>Looks like a significant peak in late 2019, decreasing ever since. Thanks gtrendsR.</p>
<p>So there you go.
What’s the equivalent to Q’apla or Kree in English?<br />
YEET!</p>

Here’s one of the Vines that contributed to Yeet’s popularity.</p>
