  I've been playing around with the idea of bringing together a bunch of my boat's information and control systems into one slightly more [cohesive control console.](/2020/06/09/command-interface-connecting-devices/)

I put a little bit of time into putting together an appropriate console to test the pump control. {{% marginnote %}} The control system for the pump is hopefully only a stopgap solution. It should be possible to control all the systems without having to go out to the internet and back. Also I want to be able to get some of the data out of the pump controller, which this method doesn't allow. {{% /marginnote %}} Now, given that I'm amassive nerd, and given that my boat is the same size as a [danube class runabout](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Danube_class) (without the warp nacelles) I thought I'd aim for an appropriately styled interface throughout.

First off, since were using R, the obvious framework for the interactive interface is to use [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Shiny is a lovely library that rolls together pretty much everything you need to produce an interactive interface to R. It's really good.

There are a few different aesthetics that you can add on top of shiny. These are mostly to help you make dashboards to show all t he pretty graphs you've made. Lucky for me [Matthew Leonawicz](https://twitter.com/leonawicz) has put together a [library to theme shiny to look like LCARS.](https://leonawicz.github.io/lcars/index.html).

Here's an incredibly early version that I put together this evening just to make some buttons that I can press to turn the pump on and off.

I need to get the alternate control system up and running so I can put some status alerts and graphs in the surrounding spaces.

Another nice library that I've added is the config library, so that I can add ship name, ship registration and the secret key in a seperate .yml file.
