<p>R studio has a very helpful tool called snippets.
{{% marginnote %}} So… this was supposed to be a very quick post about a nice thing I found to speed up my workflow. But I wanted to write in the post the literal shortcodes used. This meant that they were interpreted and turned into a marginnote rather than displayed.<br />
What I needed to do was <em>escape</em> the shortcodes, but nothing I tried seemed to work. After <em>a lot</em> more googling than I’m really happy admitting I posted a stack exchange question and someone got me the answer. But it was surprisingly hard to discover for what I had assumed would be a straightforward thing.<br />
It is apparently an undocumented feature.
{{% /marginnote %}}
Snippets let you designate an alias for small bits of code that you use often. You can assign a shortcut to a piece of code and call it up when you need it. These also work in markdown documents, like this one.</p>
<p>For example, The shortcode to add a marginnote is:</p>
<p>{{%/* marginnote <em>/%}}
…
{{%/</em> /marginnote */%}}</p>
<p>It’s not particularly complicated, but it’s annoying. So I added a snippet.
Now I type “margin” and press SHIFT + TAB and it automatically fills in what I need.</p>
