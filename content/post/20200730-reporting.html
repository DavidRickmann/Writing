<p>In many ways I am very lazy. I think probably most people who are interested in code are. {{% marginnote %}} The proof of this is that this post has been in draft for several months. {{% /marginnote %}}</p>
<p>By that I mean, lazy in a creative way. Why do hours of painstaking work if you can write a script that does this for you.<br />
There is an adage which suggests that “anything you need to do more than once should be a function” I don’t know if I’d go that far, but it’s certainly close to true.
{{% marginnote %}} That said I’ve definitely spent 10 hours automated a 30 second task in the past. {{% /marginnote %}}</p>
<p>In freelance or consulting work this can be very favourable because time very directly is money. If you can achieve something quickly {{% marginnote %}} So long as it’s done to a high standard that is. I’m not suggesting you cut corners to make a buck. That’s a bad way to go. {{% /marginnote %}} with automation or existing code or what have you then you can deliver early, you can bill fewer hours or if it’s a fixed price contract you can make more profit.</p>
<p>So one thing I’m interested in, is getting R to add in as much in the way of reporting and documentation as possible.
I’m going to leave documentation to one side for now, because it’s hard and is never done properly and requires a post (or several) of it’s own and I’m going to look at automated reporting.</p>
<p>I’ve been quite lax in writing for a bit, so I’m going to start by pulling some fairly basic stuff into this site and tie into my end of month report and I’ll expand upon that as I go.</p>
<p>There are two main places to look for data to report on, for data about me there is <a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=DavidRickmann">exist.io</a> or for data about the boat there is the <a href="https://www.openhab.org/">OpenHab</a> server. This is reporting on me, so we’ll be looking at exist.io.</p>
