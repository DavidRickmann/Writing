# Intro

This nice thing about this being in draft rather than written up all at once is that I can add in a bit at the start reminding myself what it is I want to do this month. Then, when I inevitably fail to do that I can make a note that I didn't do it. {{% marginnote %}} Or in all probability just delete the note and pretend I didn't plan it at all.   {{% /marginnote %}} So that in mind I'll make a new section called Plans for the month.

# Plans for the month

## Update my professional website.

A regular task in consulting is attaching CV's to project bids. That's always a bit of a nuisance, because you need to think of good example projects you've worked on which match the required experience. I started keeping a record of projects I'd worked on, on my wiki, but then realised I should transfer the whole thing to my proper website. I have not done a good job at that, so I want to get s bunch of projects on there properly.

## Fix the kitchen

The kitchen broke. Mainly because of my fairly mediocre plumbing. {{% marginnote %}} Well, my plumbing that I very much cut corners on because I was short on time.  {{% /marginnote %}} So I'm kind of forced to go in and fix it so we have a sink working. I'm going to take the opportunity to tidy it up a bit more. Do the plumbing properly, install the socket housings which I bought maybe 5 years ago and maybe even do some tiling.
I'd also like to get the oven fully serviced, but I don't want to do that so I'm going to hire someone for that.

## Finally write that automated reporting post that's been lurking in my drafts for ages.

I mentioned it last month. I want to hook the blog up to my stats recorder and automatically provide some KPIs. It turned out that it's slightly difficult {{% marginnote %}} Not actually difficult, just difficult enough to make me put off doing it when I could be doing other important projects, like playing A LOT of XCOM {{% /marginnote %}} so I kept putting it off.
