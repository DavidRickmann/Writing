## River freight and local hubs.

Most towns in Britain are built around a river. Not all, but most.
This is because rivers provide several vital functions. 

Firstly, how do you get fresh water.
Secondly, how do you get rid of sewage.
Rivers are great at both of these, for a while. But as the numbers go up, so do the problems.

Rivers are also pretty great for moving stuff around.
But we don't do that anymore. Why now?
