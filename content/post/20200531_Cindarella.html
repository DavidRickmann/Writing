<p>I was just watching the new(ish) <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1661199/">Cinderella film</a> (Because I have a small child who was busy ignoring it). It was pretty good. Though true to the original animated one Cinderella has basically zero agency and things just happen to her. {{% marginnote%}} I liked <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRickmann/status/1267048081436151811">the goose</a> though. {{% /marginnote %}}</p>
<p>It made me think of some alternate takes on the story.</p>

<h2>Magic as a weapon of social privilege.</h2>
<p>Cinderella marries Prince Charming {{% marginnote %}} He’s lucky he’s a prince, with a name like that. Mr. Charming Jones would sound… huh, no it actually kind of works. Forget I mentioned it. {{% /marginnote %}} and, as per the story her wicked stepsisters leave the kingdom and never return. But they know something is up. They realise that the coach, the horses, the slipper and the dress were all caused by magic. They plot and scheme and realise that the way to raise your status in the social hierarchy is clearly tactical use of magic.</p>
<p>Soon every eligible young noble in the country is contracting magical assistance to seduce the next rank up. The very best fairy godmothers are retained only by the ultra wealthy. Every ball is a display of more and more elaborate magical dresses, glittering coaches formed from unlikely vegetables and unwilling animals twisted into human shape and magically forced to serve.
A particularly devious matriarch realises that the only way to top her rivals is strategically deployed counter spells. The first princess to find herself unexpectly wearing rags whilst sitting amongst the ruined remains of large celeriac was a shock to high society. But soon the social scene is awash with duelling magicians battling to maintain their glamours, or pierce those of their rivals.</p>
<p>Into this melee of magic walks a humble serving girl with a simple dress and no magical aid whatsoever. She catches the eye of a weary prince who is tired of all the magical finery around him. A new chapter of social intrigue begins…</p>
