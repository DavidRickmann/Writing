I'm a little wary of the DRAFT functionality in blogdown/hugo. So this might get published too soon if it doesn't work.
I guess we'll see if it does.

This will hopefully be a bit more complete than last month's entry. I'm going to try and keep it updated as I go.
So, in roughly date order:

Bought the child tiny potion bottles so she can make tiny potions. They're adorable and imported from china for pennies. So almost certainly environmentally and ethically atrocious. Something to work on.

Added a "Related content" section to [Lisa's notebook](http://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk). Her site is so much better than this one. {{% marginnote %}} I mean, contentwise, sure that was obvious, because she is good at writing and I am not. But I mean technically better. {{% /marginnote %}} This may seem odd because I update them both. I will probably import some of the improvements over at some point. 
Features her site has that mine does not include:

* Multi tiered taxonomies: There are four indices in use on her site:
  * Series: For things which are part of the same series of things (like ["How Not To Think Like Sherlock Holmes"](https://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk/series/how-not-to-think-like-sherlock-holmes/) )
  * Refs: Philosophers or Authors who she has mentioned in a post.
  * Tags: Related keywords. This is a bit vague and isn't used as much.
  * Categories: A secret hidden taxonomy used to tweak related content recommendations. 
* The aforementioned related content. This looks at all the other posts and compares it to all the others on the above taxonomies (plus date) and then decides which ones are related. Each taxonomy is weighted, so things in the same series are the most important whereas things written on the same date are the least. That said, Lisa didn't like it very much, so I removed it.
But, figuring it out and getting it working was pretty satisfying. So it was worth doing.

* I fixed most of the Build warnings. The template I started with was created with an older version of Hugo which changed in the meantime. So every time it builds I get some warnings telling me something is deprecated and I should remove it. I've done that on hers. I haven't yet done it here.
* Social Media meta tags. It makes Twitter cards with nice images and does something on facebook that I don't understand. {{% marginnote %}} I added Facebook Opengraph metatags. But I don't use facebook and she doesn't post links to her site there. Most of them are duplicates of the Twitter tags anyway, so it's not great hardship to have those added.  {{% /marginnote %}}

* Oh. On preview it also has fixed formatting so that bullet points aren't oddly squished. I had better import that fix to this site before I publish this post.

  
Made a watermelon juice dispenser out of a watermelon. Then threw it off a bridge.  

I've looked up a few more "Make a watermelon juice dispenser" videos.
I like this one:
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "8EOzqEoL4mQ")
```
Because 
* it advises you to trim the base so it can stand up.   
* Mentions that you must strain the watermelon or you'll clog the tap.
* Also adds A LOT of rum.
