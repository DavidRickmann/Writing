My wife is running some workshops [on critical thinking](https://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk/page/sherlock/) and why Sherlock Holmes is actually bad at it.
I've taken this opportunity to explore different ways to market this course.

I wanted to know how different ways of getting people's attention might work. {{% marginnote %}} This blog isn't one of them. It's not really here for anyone to actually read.   {{% /marginnote %}} The first thing I needed was a landing page so that I could see clearly on the analytics if people were following my links. That's the page linked to above.

I had a voucher for google adwords, so I took out an ad linked to that page. 

Fortuitously at the some time someone on twitter tweeted this:

{{% tweet 1282708852362956808 %}}

I enjoyed this tweet and joined in with a less funny version of basically the same joke. {{% marginnote %}} I generated a stock meme, on the same theme and tweeted it. It's a bit "Reply-Guy" style behaviour, but hopefully not too terrible. I was aiming more to engage with the suggestion that everyone was going to start making memes on the same subject. Anyway... it's a fine line, replying to other people's better jokes on Twitter. {{% /marginnote %}}
This was more popular than I expected, so, as part of an experiment I popped a "Check out my soundcloud" style tweet, linked to that same landing page.

After a day or so I checked the analytics for one day.

* Paid search advert: 9 (cost per click approx Â£1.50) 
* Twitter referral: 26 (cost per click 0)

A clear win for the viral tweet.

The conclusions here are so far that active social media engagement seems to be way better than paid advertising, especially for a very very small operation. Even a completely unrelated tweet garnered massively more traffic value than the paid search. Additionally, the paid search seems *really* expensive. This might be because I set it up badly (I definitely don't know what I'm doing when it comes to marketing) but it seems that I'm paying on an on click basis. I definitely would not have wanted to pay so much money for the results if it weren't for the voucher I'm using. 

Anyway....
