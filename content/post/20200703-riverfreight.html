<h2>River freight and local hubs.</h2>
<p>Most towns in Britain are built around a river. Not all, but most.
This is because rivers provide several vital functions.</p>
<p>Firstly, how do you get fresh water.
Secondly, how do you get rid of sewage.
Rivers are great at both of these, for a while. But as the numbers go up, so do the problems.</p>
<p>Rivers are also pretty great for moving stuff around.
But we donâ€™t do that anymore. Why now?</p>
