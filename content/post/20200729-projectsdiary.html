<p>I’m going to try and keep a track of how various projects are going all in one place and push it at the end of the month.
This means I can make a note of smaller progress that doesn’t warrant a post of it’s own.</p>

<h3>2nd July 2020</h3>
<p>Another fairly radical overhaul.
I’ve set up an openhab server. Openhab has already done the hard work of setting up bindings to common household smart devices. I’m generally a fan of not reinventing the wheel. This also means there is a whole community of folks working on interesting ways to talk to house gadgets.
I’m assuming there isn’t going to be an Openhab binding for rudder hydraulics or diesel engine controls.
I want this system to be doing more than just smarthome gadget control (though that is very much the core use case) so I’m planning a hybrid system. The openhab server handling talking to all the gadgets and then the Interface on top.</p>
<p>Openhab as a REST API so I’ve rewritten all the controls to use that. It’s pretty quick to add more.</p>
<p>I’ve ordered a wifi light switch from China which was quite cheap but will take months to arrive.
I’ve heard mixed reviews, but if it works I will get a couple more. The boat doesn’t actually have main lights in the hold, only lamps. So I can build the automation in at source when I finally get round to installing them.</p>
