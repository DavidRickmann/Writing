There are two approaches to the Twitter bio space. 
You could write a sensible description of yourself that people might find helpful or informative, or you can just put a bunch of nonsense that you think sounds nice.
I prefer the second option.

I also like to change them fairly often so here is a list of some Twitter Bios from most recent to least recent.
