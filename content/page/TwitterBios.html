<p>There are two approaches to the Twitter bio space.
You could write a sensible description of yourself that people might find helpful or informative, or you can just put a bunch of nonsense that you think sounds nice.
I prefer the second option.</p>
<p>I also like to change them fairly often so here is a list of some Twitter Bios from most recent to least recent.</p>
<div id="th-september-2019" class="section level2">
<h2>20th September 2019</h2>
<div id="more-a-mermaid-than-a-ghost-more-a-castle-than-a-manor" class="section level3">
<h3>“More a Mermaid than a Ghost, More a Castle than a Manor”</h3>
<p>I was trying to describe the Nereid to players in the Hidden Shrine of Tamochoan. I called her a water spirit, but I didn’t want the players to think she was insubstantial (or was an actual mermaid). They found the phrasing funny,
A week later in a different game the DM described a run down mansion as “More a Castle than a Manor”. The players found the juxtaposition funny and I thought it sounded a bit poetic. So there we go.</p>
