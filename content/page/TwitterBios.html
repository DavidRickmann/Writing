<p>There are two approaches to the Twitter bio space.
You could write a sensible description of yourself that people might find helpful or informative, or you can just put a bunch of nonsense that you think sounds nice.
I prefer the second option.</p>
<p>I also like to change them fairly often so here is a list of some Twitter Bios from most recent to least recent.</p>
<div id="th-september-2019" class="section level2">
<h2>30th September 2019</h2>
<div id="its-me-nono-small-robot-you-know-friend-of-ulysses" class="section level3">
<h3>“It’s me Nono, small robot you know! Friend of Ulysses”</h3>
<p>This is a line from the theme tune to the 1980’s French/Japanese animated show Ulysses 31.
It’s a really weird line, because no one else gets introduced in the credits (except Ulysses himself and I suppose very briefly Telemachus, his son.)
Also it doesn’t really fit into the song at all.</p>

<div id="th-september-2019-1" class="section level2">
<h2>20th September 2019</h2>
<div id="more-a-mermaid-than-a-ghost-more-a-castle-than-a-manor" class="section level3">
<h3>“More a Mermaid than a Ghost, More a Castle than a Manor”</h3>
<p>I was trying to describe the Nereid to players in the Hidden Shrine of Tamochoan. I called her a water spirit, but I didn’t want the players to think she was insubstantial (or was an actual mermaid). They found the phrasing funny,
A week later in a different game the DM described a run down mansion as “More a Castle than a Manor”. The players found the juxtaposition funny and I thought it sounded a bit poetic. So there we go.</p>
