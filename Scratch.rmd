## Checking
 
 Checking is important.

Why checking is important

checking your results


checking as you go
In data science you will often be taking a set of inputs and transforming them






## Why autonomous cars are not a solution.

The problem with cars is not anything to do with humans having to drive them.


## River freight and local hubs.

Most towns in Britain are built around a river. Not all, but most.
This is because rivers provide several vital functions. 

Firstly, how do you get fresh water.
Secondly, how do you get rid of sewage.
Rivers are great at both of these, for a while. But as the numbers go up, so do the problems.

Rivers are also pretty great for moving stuff around.
But we don't do that anymore. Why now?

## Being an expert
I'm at an odd point with expertise. I'm clearly an expert at something. I have all the trappings. I tend to be employed as a senior something or a principal something else. I've been doing what is now called "Data Science" for at least 15 years. But I don't really feel like I know anything. Or at least, everything I do think I know is very obvious. Anyone could do it.
The problem is (I hope) to do with 
Everything I read is written by people who really do know what they're doing. Those are the people I want to learn things from. There are lots of them and they all know a lot of things that I do not know. Those are the intersting and useful skills, not the ones I've got.
For now I will try and comfort myself with the thought that it's my expertise that highlights 

## Creating a recipe Schema

*More on cooking*
Should we key the ingredients?
Does it make sense to have butter (for example) listed more than once.
Well, yes, if you use it for different things.
Quite often a cake will have butter but will also have butter cream frosting. If it's all listed together you need to specifiy in the recipe how much to use. I think it would be better to have a field listing sub assemblies of the recipe and keying on sub assembly+ingredient
