Daily Writing Exercises



*Why to write every day?*

There are a lot of articles about maing writing every day a habit.

Find some links.

Engineers (a category which I broadly include myself, if only because I don't know what other title I can choose) are not very good writers.
From what I can tell there is only one way to improve this, and that is by writing. My wife started a daily(ish) (writing habit)[notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk] and was very quickly churning out very good writing. This is not really a surprise, she's a philosopher, and their deliverables take the form of writing. They usually don't even have any graphs in! This is something she should be (and is) good at. 

By contrast. I'm an engineer, we pretend that our outputs are something other than writing, but in a fundamental way 

I think I should revisit this article regularly.

*Why autonomous cars are not a solution.*

The problem with cars is not anything to do with humans having to drive them.



*River freight and local hubs.*

Most towns in Britain are built around a river. Not all, but most.
This is because rivers provide several vital functions. 

Firstly, how do you get fresh water.
Secondly, how do you get rid of sewage.
Rivers are great at both of these, for a while. But as the numbers go up, so do the problems.

Rivers are also pretty great for moving stuff around.
But we don't do that anymore. Why now?




*Last mile for humans and for freight.*
Magway, drone hubs.

*Epistemic groups within transport or engineering*

*Building self presenting models with R *

*Replacing powerpoint with R Shiny*

*R Markdown experiments*

embedding graphs and stuff in R markdown
```{r cool-plot, fig.cap='A cool plot.'}
plot(cars, pch = 20)  # not really cool
```


*Transport data formats*
GTFS
TransXChange
CIF
Etc.

*More on cooking*
Should we key the ingredients?
Does it make sense to have butter (for example) listed more than once.
Well, yes, if you use it for different things.
Quite often a cake will have butter but will also have butter cream frosting. If it's all listed together you need to specifiy in the recipe how much to use. I think it would be better to have a field listing sub assemblies of the recipe and keying on sub assembly+ingredient 
reference cooking for engineers


*Being an expert*
I'm at an odd point with expertise. I'm clearly an expert at something. I have all the trappings. I tend to be employed as a senior something or a principal something else. I've been doing what is now called "Data Science" for at least 15 years. But I don't really feel like I know anything. Or at least, everything I do think I know is very obvious. Anyone could do it.
The problem is (I hope) to do with 
Everything I read is written by people who really do know what they're doing. Those are the people I want to learn things from. There are lots of them and they all know a lot of things that I do not know. Those are the intersting and useful skills, not the ones I've got.
For now I will try and comfort myself with the thought that it's my expertise that highlights
