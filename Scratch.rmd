Daily Writing Exercises



*Why to write every day?*

There are a lot of articles about maing writing every day a habit.

Find some links.

Engineers (a category which I broadly include myself, if only because I don't know what other title I can choose) are not very good writers.
From what I can tell there is only one way to improve this, and that is by writing. My wife started a daily(ish) (writing habit)[notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk] and was very quickly churning out very good writing. This is not really a surprise, she's a philosopher, and their deliverables take the form of writing. They usually don't even have any graphs in! This is something she should be (and is) good at. 

By contrast. I'm an engineer, we pretend that our outputs are something other than writing, but in a fundamental way 

I think I should revisit this article regularly.

*Why autonomous cars are not a solution.*

The problem with cars is not anything to do with humans having to drive them.



*River freight and local hubs.*

Most towns in Britain are built around a river. Not all, but most.
This is because rivers provide several vital functions. 

Firstly, how do you get fresh water.
Secondly, how do you get rid of sewage.
Rivers are great at both of these, for a while. But as the numbers go up, so do the problems.

Rivers are also pretty great for moving stuff around.
But we don't do that anymore. Why now?

*R Markdown experiments*

embedding graphs and stuff in R markdown
```{r cool-plot, fig.cap='A cool plot.'}
plot(cars, pch = 20)  # not really cool
```
